# **Introduction**



# **Methods**



# **Results**
During the work, 50 genes with significant differential expression were selected and ranked by p-value. Functional annotation allowed for their distribution into Gene Ontology (GO) categories. For each category, both the number of genes present among the selected 50 and their total representation in the annotated genome were calculated. Summary data are presented in Table 1.
